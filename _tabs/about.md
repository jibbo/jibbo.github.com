![me](http://blog.jibbo.it/assets/img/about.jpg "me")

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Giovanni De Francesco, also known as Jibbo, welcome to this blog!

I'm a dreamer, an insufferable perfectionist and also highly ambitious. All this traits make me push hard everyday in many aspects of life that I like, such as: metal music, weight lifting and app development. Yeah, I like to be busy!

During the day, I work as an Android Lead at [Qonto](https://qonto.com/en) (all opinions expressed on this blog are my own!), previously I worked for [Everli](https://it.everli.com/it/), also known as Supermercato24. At a certain point I even founded my own startup (Gluebus, Rest In Peace ðŸª¦)!

Living in Italy near Lake Garda, I'm lucky that good food is never hard to come byâ€”it's my guilty pleasure! Of course, this makes it even more challenging to achieve my fitness goals, despite training four times a week.

When I'm not working or training, I still try to code a few of my own apps, which you can find on the Play Store or App Store.

Thank you for visiting my page! Feel free to connect or check out my latest work!
